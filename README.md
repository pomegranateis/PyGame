# Multiplayer Snake Game

## Game Description
Welcome to the Multiplayer Snake Game! This is a classic arcade game where two players compete against each other to become the last snake standing. Each player controls their own snake, navigating around the screen to eat apples and grow longer while avoiding collisions with themselves or the opponent.

## Features
- Two-player local multiplayer mode
- Simple yet engaging gameplay
- Dynamic apple spawning to keep the game challenging
- Score tracking for each player
- Visually appealing graphics with Pygame

## Installation
To play the game, you will need Python installed on your computer. Additionally, you will need to install the `pygame` library if you haven't already. You can install it using pip:




## How to Play
The game starts with two snakes at opposite ends of the screen. Use the following keys to control the first snake:
- W: Move Up
- A: Move Left
- S: Move Down
- D: Move Right

For the second player, use the arrow keys:
- Up Arrow: Move Up
- Left Arrow: Move Left
- Down Arrow: Move Down
- Right Arrow: Move Right

Eat apples to grow longer and increase your score. Be careful not to collide with yourself or the opponent's snake, as this will result in game over.
